{\bfseries{raylib is a simple and easy-\/to-\/use library to enjoy videogames programming.}}

raylib is highly inspired by Borland B\+GI graphics lib and by X\+NA framework and it\textquotesingle{}s specially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

{\itshape N\+O\+TE for A\+D\+V\+E\+N\+T\+U\+R\+E\+RS\+: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no auto-\/debugging... just coding in the most pure spartan-\/programmers way.}

raylib uses on its \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/core.c}{\texttt{ core}} module the outstanding \href{http://www.glfw.org/}{\texttt{ G\+L\+F\+W3}} library, embedded in the form of \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rglfw.c}{\texttt{ rglfw}} module, to avoid external dependencies.

raylib uses on its \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/raudio.c}{\texttt{ raudio}} module, the amazing \href{https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio}{\texttt{ miniaudio}} library to support multiple platforms and multiple audio backends.

raylib uses internally multiple single-\/file header-\/only libraries to support different fileformats loading and saving, all those libraries are embedded with raylib and available in \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/src/external}{\texttt{ src/external}} directory. Check \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-dependencies}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}} for a detailed list.

{\itshape On Android platform, {\ttfamily native\+\_\+app\+\_\+glue module} module (provided by Android N\+DK) and native Android libraries are used to manage window/context, inputs and activity life cycle.}

{\itshape On Raspberry Pi platform (native mode), {\ttfamily Videocore A\+PI} and {\ttfamily E\+GL} libraries are used for window/context management. Inputs are processed using {\ttfamily evdev} Linux libraries}\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md44}{}\doxysubsection{build and installation}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md44}
Binary releases for Windows, Linux and mac\+OS are available at the \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases}{\texttt{ Github Releases page}}. raylib is also available via multiple package managers on multiple OS distributions. Check \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}} for more info.

If you wish to build raylib yourself, \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ the raylib Wiki}} also contains detailed instructions on how to approach that.

raylib has been developed using two tools\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Notepad++ (text editor) -\/ \href{http://notepad-plus-plus.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://notepad-\/plus-\/plus.\+org}}
\item Min\+GW (G\+CC compiler) -\/ \href{http://www.mingw.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+mingw.\+org}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Those are the tools recommended to enjoy raylib development.\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md45}{}\doxysubsection{contact}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md45}
