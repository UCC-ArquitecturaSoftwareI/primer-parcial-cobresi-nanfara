This is a project template to be used with \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jubalh/raymario/master/meson.build}{\texttt{ G\+N\+O\+ME Builder}}. We use the \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jubalh/raymario/master/meson.build}{\texttt{ meson}} build system here.

We can compile our project via the command line\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{meson build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{ninja}
\DoxyCodeLine{ninja install}
\end{DoxyCode}


Or can simply click on the {\ttfamily meson.\+build} file to open it with Builder. Alternatively you can open Builder first and click on the {\ttfamily open} button and the left top.

We added comments to the file to give you an idea which values you should edit. For a full overview of options please check the \href{http://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html}{\texttt{ meson manual}}.

In the provided file we assume that the build file is located at the root folder of your project, and that all your sources are in a {\ttfamily src} subfolder.

Check out the {\ttfamily examples} directory for a simple example on how to use this template. You can also look at \href{https://github.com/jubalh/raymario}{\texttt{ raymario}} for a slightly more complex example which also installs resource files.
