This document contains a set of guidelines to contribute to the project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{raylib philosophy}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item raylib is a tool to enjoy videogames programming, every single function in raylib should be a tutorial on itself.
\item raylib is S\+I\+M\+P\+LE and E\+A\+S\+Y-\/\+T\+O-\/\+U\+SE, I tried to keep it compact with a small set of functions, if a function is too complex or is not clearly useful, better not to include it.
\item raylib is open source and free; educators and institutions can use this tool to T\+E\+A\+CH videogames programming completely by free.
\item raylib is collaborative; contribution of tutorials / code examples / bug fixes / code comments are highly appreciated.
\item raylib\textquotesingle{}s license (and its external libs respective licenses) allow using it for commercial products.

\href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}} contains some information about the library and is open to anyone for edit. Feel free to review it if required, just take care not to break something.\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{raylib C coding conventions}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md4}
Despite being written in C, raylib does not follow the standard Hungarian notation for C, it \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-coding-conventions}{\texttt{ follows Pascal-\/case/camel-\/case notation}}, more common on C\# language. All code formatting decisions have been carefully taken to make it easier for students to read, write and understand code.

Source code is extensively commented for that purpose, raylib primary learning method is\+:

\begin{quote}
learn by reading code and examples \end{quote}


For detailed information on building raylib and examples, please see \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki}{\texttt{ raylib Wiki}}.\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Opening new Issues}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md5}
To open new issue for raylib (bug, enhancement, discussion...), just try to follow these rules\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the issue has not already been reported before by searching on Git\+Hub under Issues.
\item If you\textquotesingle{}re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
\item If applies, attach some screenshot of the issue and a .zip file with the code sample and required resources.
\item On issue description, add a brackets tag about the raylib module that relates to this issue. If don\textquotesingle{}t know which module, just report the issue, I will review it.
\item You can check other issues to see how is being done!
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Sending a Pull-\/\+Request}\label{md_cmake-build-debug__deps_raylib-src__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t send big pull requests (lots of changelists), they are difficult to review. It\textquotesingle{}s better to send small pull requests, one at a time.
\item Verify that changes don\textquotesingle{}t break the build (at least on Windows platform). As many platforms where you can test it, the better, but don\textquotesingle{}t worry if you cannot test all the platforms.

If you have any doubt, don\textquotesingle{}t hesitate to \href{mailto:ray@raylib.com}{\texttt{ contact me}}!. You can write me a direct mail but you can also contact me on the following networks\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
